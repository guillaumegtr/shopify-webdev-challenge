# Features ðŸ‘Œ

I decided to build the following project using React Typescript and Redux âš›. This is the web front-end framework that I have the most experience with.

**Simple and clean design is what I aimed for concerning UI/UX** ðŸ§¼

### Implemented features

- Search OMDB and display the results (movies, series and episodes)

- Add a movie from the search results to a nomination list

- Nominations are saved in local storage

- Remove a nomination from the list

## Technical requirements ðŸŽ¯

- Search results should come from OMDB's API (free API key: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx) âœ”

- Each search result should list at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film âœ”

- Updates to the search terms should update the result list âœ”

- Movies in search results can be added and removed from the nomination list âœ”

- If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button âœ”

- Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations âœ”

- Web app hosted (on Heroku) âœ”

## Extras done ðŸŒŸ

- Nomination list is saved when user leaves the page (browser's localStorage)

- Animations for loading, adding/deleting a nomination and notification sound when doing so

- Pretty view with extra details on nominated movies

- Shareable links
